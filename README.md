# Gauss_Jordan_Elimination

In this code I use apply Gauss Jordan Elimination to 
an (n x n) matrix.

It displays it after the first itteration as an upper triangular matrix
and then as a diagonal matrix after the second itteration.

This method is used to solve a system of n equations with n unknowns.

At the end we output the solution to the system of equations.
